We decided to enable sign-in with Google.
We redirect the user to the Google OAuth flow through Passport.
Passport sends the user to Google's permission screen.
The user grants permission, and Google redirects back to our specified redirect URI with a code.
We call passport.authenticate again, and Passport sees the code in the URL.
Passport exchanges the code with Google for the user's profile information.
Google sends back the profile information, which triggers Passport's callback function.
